# Hi, I'm Logan
I'm a Computer Science senior interested in cybersecurity operations and detection engineering.
I focus on understanding system behavior (processes, memory, logs, and network activity) and using it to investigate security events.

My background combines:
- Threat Intelligence (attacker behavior)
- GRC (risk and controls)
- Low-level systems programming (what the machine is actually doing)

I've also used programming to further my interests: linguistics, studying foreign languages, and Brazilian jiu jitsu.
